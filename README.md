# Professional Portfolio 
## Description
    
    I want to create an app that lets me dispaly myself and my work to potential employeers!
    Recruiters/employers are now able to go to my page and see a professional layout of me and my work to see if i'm a good candidate for them. I learned React and a few unique libraries it offers as well as react router.
